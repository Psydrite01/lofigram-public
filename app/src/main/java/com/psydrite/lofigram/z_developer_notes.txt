Bug catching session 🐛 summary:

8) "Reset sessions" text is confusing, change to "reset sessions counter", reset test session (pomodoro) [Done]
9) on signout: reset pomodoro and sleep timer + mediaplayer.stopsong + stop notification + cancel any scheduled notification (no need to cancel any ongoing downloads) [Done]
done 10) change lock icon to cooldown icon
done 11) When a premium user is logged in on the app and caches a song or a screen saver, when he signs out and logs in without google, the songs stream but the download icon still shows tick, likely due it still being in cache, similarly for screensaver
